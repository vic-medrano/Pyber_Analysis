# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analzye ride-sharing data. This data is to be presented to V. Isualize to explain differences among rural, suburban, and urban city types. The differences that will be examined in the analysis will look at specific aspects for each city type such as the amount of rides taken, the number of drivers, the average fare and a few other aspects.
## Results
### Differences Among Cities

Given the assumed population differences between the city types, it is no surprise that Urban has a greater amount of total rides (1625 rides) than Rural (125 rides) and Suburban (625 rides) combined. To account for the large number of total rides for urban cities, there is also a greater amount of drivers for urban cities and a larger amount of total fares when compared to the other two city types. However, when looking at average fare per ride, rides are more expensive in the rural cities and less expensive in urban cities. Additionally, the average fare per driver for rural cities is more than three times the urban average fare.

When looking at the line graph of a four month period, it can be seen that urban fares seem to fluctuate more than the ohther two city types.
## Summary
Possible business recommendations to reduce the differences among city types may be to increase the drivers in the rural area. It is highly likely that customers from rural cities have longer trip times which may greatly affect their average fare. Due to this difference it may also be helpful for PyBer to analyze fares by mileage to paint a more accurate represenation as urban cities may have longer travel times and greater distances than when compared to riders in suburban and urban city types. It may also be beneficial to hire more drivers for the rural city type
