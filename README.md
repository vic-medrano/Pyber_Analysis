Given the assumed population differences between the city types, it is no surprise that Urban has a greater amount of total rides (1625 rides) than Rural (125 rides) and Suburban (625 rides) combined. To account for the large number of total rides for urban cities, there is also a greater amount of drivers for urban cities and a larger amount of total fares when compared to the other two city types. However, when looking at average fare per ride, rides are more expensive in the rural cities and less expensive in urban cities. Additionally, the average fare per driver for rural cities is more than three times the urban average fare.
